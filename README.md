# Jenkins CI - Shared libries

Find out Jenkins [shared libraries](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/shared-libraries/) for build notification to your slack channel.

As Pipeline is adopted for more and more projects in an organization, common patterns are likely to emerge. Oftentimes it is useful to share parts of Pipelines between various projects to reduce redundancies and keep code "DRY

jenkins Pipeline has support for creating "Shared Libraries" which can be defined in external source control repositories and loaded into existing Pipelines


I successfuly used this feature on this [project](https://github.com/NewtonCosta/NewtonCosta.github.io) ::wink::
